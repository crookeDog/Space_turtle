# Space Turtle - Space Adventure Game

Space Turtle is a space action game developed in Python using the Turtle library. The game puts the player in control of a space turtle that must face alien spacecraft, collect power-ups, and destroy invaders. The player can move left or right and shoot projectiles for defense.

## Features

- **Player Movement**: Move the turtle left or right using the arrow keys.
- **Shoot Projectiles**: Press the spacebar to shoot projectiles at the invaders.
- **Invaders**: The invaders move left and right and gradually descend. If an invader touches the turtle, the game ends.
- **Alien Spacecraft**: A giant alien spacecraft appears during the game with a health bar. The player must hit it with projectiles to reduce its health and win.
- **Power-ups**: Occasionally, blue power-ups appear in the game. The player can collect them to increase the turtle’s movement speed and reduce the invaders’ speed.
